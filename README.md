#go-rest-api-course

This code is the product of a great tutorial on tutorialedge. 

The tutorial claims that this will be a production ready api, and I guess it gets pretty close, getting all the way through jwt access control.  

Maybe it needs a bit of refactoring, and I guess it would really benefit from some unit tests, but as it stands it is a great collection of prod-ready tid-bits that will probably save some time as a reference on a real project.
